\chapter{The second real chapter}\label{ch:chap3}
\section{A section with citations}\label{sec:seccite}

Two items are cited here. The are  \textit{The \LaTeX\ Companion} book \cite{latexcompanion}, and the Einstein journal paper \cite{einstein}. A third citation is in Subsection \ref{subsec:subsec}

\subsection{An example subsection}\label{subsec:subsec}

The third citation is Donald Knuth's website \cite{knuthwebsite}. These examples, in the commented-out section of the original ETD template in this repository, show examples of the other ways citations can be handled by Biblatex. This is not possible with the version of Biblatex that comes with the Ubuntu 18.04 package manager texlive suite, so these are not shown in this example. Those styles are unnecessary for physics theses.
