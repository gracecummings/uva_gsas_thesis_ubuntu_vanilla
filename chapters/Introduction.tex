\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:intro}

This is the introduction to your thesis. Most folks write this last, since they do not fully know what will go in the thesis until it is written. At least that is how it is in the field of collider physics. Do whatever floats your boat, writing a thesis is hard enough as it is, without taking disembodied advice from a thesis template.
