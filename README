To make the October 2021 version of the UVa GSAS LaTex thesis template work on the texlive installs available from the Ubuntu libraries is non trivial. I had a borked version of LaTex running on my local distribution, so here is what I did to get it running. This template was modified to run on a older version of Biblatex, so most humanities citations are not available in this repo.

First, I had to uninstall texlive (several times)

`sudo apt remove --purge tex-common '^texlive'`
`sudo rm -rf /etc/texmf/`
`sudo apt-get remove --purge tex-common texlive-*`
`sudo apt autoremove`

Now, reinstall it

`sudo apt install tex-common`
`sudo apt install texlive-base`
`sudo apt install texlive-bibtex-extra`
`sudo apt install texlive-extra-utils
`sudo apt install texlive-pstricks`
`sudo apt install texlive-latex-extra`
`sudo apt install texlive-xetex`
`sudo apt install biber`


Now, to actually tex the thing, do

`xelatex UVA_ETD_template.tex`
`biber UVA_ETD_template`
`xelatex UVA_ETD_template.tex`

`
